# AAU Pandemic Ventilator Software

**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: SOFTWARE SHARED AND DESCRIBED HERE IS FOR DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES ONLY.**
**SHOULD NOT BE USED DIRECTLY IN THIS FORM FOR CONTROLLING MECHANICAL VENTILATION OF PATIENTS!**

This version of the software was used for demonstrating control of O2 and Air proportional valves for volume controlled mechanical ventilation. 
The software includes additional not yet tested functionality.

The Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) software for control of a Allen-Bradley CompactLogix 5370 (1769-L27ERM-QBFC18) has been implemented in Studio 5000 (Rockwell Automation). 
The PLC structured text code has been implemented in as generalizable format as possible for possible implementation for control of other PLCs.

The Human machine Interface (HMI) software for control of a Allen-Bradley PanelView 800 4" TFT has been implemented in Connected Components (Rockwell Automation).
